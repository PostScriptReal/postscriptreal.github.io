<h1 class="starter">Welcome to my personal website</h1>
<p>This website acts as a portfolio of all the stuff I worked on in the past and into the present.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see the projects I worked on, go to the '<a href="projs.html">Projects</a>' tab.</p>
<p>Otherwise if you'd like to know more about me, check out the '<a href="about.html">About Me</a>' tab</p>

<h1 class="starter">NEWS AND UPDATES</h1>
<h1 class="nheader">22/1/2024</h1>
<p>It's been a month since I have put the site up online and it's now time for an update! More work has been done to the MCPEDL 
  Archive, newly found archived versions of the lost Parkour+ and SKPVP pages have been found on the Internet Archive, the reason why 
  I didn't check IA before was because I hadn't thought that a random web crawler would've found and archived the pages, yet here they 
  are! <br><br>Recently (about a week ago) I had discovered an old backup folder of my MCW10 data on an old laptop, containing maps that 
  I thought were lost to time, and no it's very unlikely it will contain old versions of SKPVP and P+, nor Con-fusion (but there's a 
  chance the zombie map is there, I haven't had the time to check though). <br><br>I have uploaded the maps I have recovered already and if time
 permits, I will search and recover more. Enjoy!</p>
