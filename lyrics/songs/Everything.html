<p class="nheader">Lyrics (from NCS Lyrics)</p>
<p>I'm on my own, broke and alone<br>
I feel the rain crashing down<br>
All around this empty town<br>
I'm searching for the lost and found<br>
But you don't care, you're unaware<br>
Keep movin' like the scars aren't even there<br>
It's in the air, like a blazing flare<br>
Don't stare 'cause the flames will burn us<br>
<br>
I thought you were the one for me<br>
That's why I gave you everything<br>
Held you close by the stormy seas<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
I used to kiss your head when you cried for me<br>
Hold your hand while the pain was all around<br>
Keep you warm by the roaring sea<br>
Oh you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
My darling dear, you're never here<br>
When I'm in pain you hide and disappear<br>
Like shadows in the atmosphere<br>
Charting the stratosphere<br>
I prayed for you, and kept you near<br>
And host you chase away my fears<br>
I'm on my own, you made it so<br>
And now I'm chasing nightmares all alone<br>
<br>
I used to run with you through the great big leaves<br>
Laugh at you when you'd laugh at me<br>
Hope for us because I believed<br>
That home was just you and me<br>
I thought you were the one for me<br>
That's why I gave you everything<br>
Held you close by the stormy seas<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
Oh I'm gonna do this on my own<br>
No point in blaming you-you did not know<br>
Ooooh<br>
I thought you were the one for me<br>
That's why I gave you everything<br>
Held you close by the stormy seas<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me<br>
<br>
Oh I'm gonna do this on my own<br>
No point in blaming you-you did not know<br>
Ooooh<br>
Oh I'm gonna do this on my own<br>
No point in blaming you, you did not know<br>
Ooooh<br>
<br>
I thought you were the one for me<br>
That's why I gave you everything<br>
Held you close by the stormy seas<br>
Oh, you meant the world to me</p>
