<p>This is not a phase, my dear<br>
Time heals the moment, but our hearts were frozen<br>
Don't disappear<br>
You're scared from not knowing but I got a feeling that<br>
<br>
I'll be ready for the rest of my life<br>
Just know that I'll give you love<br>
You'll never want to share tonight, tonight<br>
If the world isn't working the way that we found it<br>
When we were too young to love<br>
Our attention is running<br>
Five seconds is burning a hole in our racing hearts<br>
<br>
I wish we could find the space, a great escape<br>
Where we could finally break the mold<br>
If it's us that we wanted, happy after the fall<br>
Then I don't want to change at all<br>
<br>
Then I don't want to change at all<br>
Then I don't want to change at all<br>
Then I don't want to change at all<br>
Life be until the end<br>
Tell me stories that I've heard a thousand and one times before<br>
I've been, let me fall into your eyes all over again and<br>
<br>
I'll be ready for the rest of my life<br>
Just know that I'll give you love<br>
You'll never want to share tonight, tonight<br>
If the world isn't working the way that we found it<br>
When we were too young to love<br>
Our attention is running<br>
Five seconds is burning a hole in our racing hearts<br>
<br>
I wish we could find the space, a great escape<br>
Where we could finally break the mold<br>
If it's us that we wanted, happy after the fall<br>
Then I don't want to change at all<br>
<br>
Then I don't want to change at all<br>
Then I don't want to change at all<br>
No-oh, no, no-oh<br>
No, no-oh, no, no-oh, no</p>
