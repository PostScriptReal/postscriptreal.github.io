<p class="nheader">Lyrics (from NCS Lyrics)</p>
<p>Oh, did you cry<br>
When I found you in the night<br>
Staying up till 5AM<br>
Told me you and him were friends<br>
Woke up in a burning home<br>
Blame myself, I should've known<br>
That staying up late, sealed our fate, buried in the catacombs<br>
Setting fire to the life we made<br>
Such a fucking waste of time<br>
Said you'd love me till my heart decays<br>
Guess my darling changed, her mind<br>
And doxxed my heart online<br>
<br>
Was I blind?<br>
Or too afraid to find<br>
That you changed your mind from sleepless nights<br>
Was I part of your design?<br>
Pushed me till I broke alone<br>
No one heard my heart explode<br>
It's a suicide dive to stay when you die<br>
And question everything you know<br>
<br>
Setting fire to the life we made<br>
Such a fucking waste of time<br>
Said you'd love me till my heart decays<br>
Guess my darling changed, her mind<br>
And doxxed my heart online<br>
<br>
Setting fire to the life we made<br>
<br>
Such a fucking waste of time<br>
Said you'd love me till my heart decays<br>
<br>
Guess my darling changed, her mind<br>
And doxxed my heart online<br>
<br>
And doxxed my heart online</p>
